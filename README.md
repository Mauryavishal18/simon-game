Simon Says is a popular memory game where the system shows a color sequence, and the player must repeat the same pattern.  
With each level, the sequence grows longer — making the game more challenging and fun.

This project focuses on:

- Clean and simple JavaScript logic  
- Interactive sound + visual feedback
